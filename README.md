# Design-and-Implementation-of-Frequency-Selective-Circuit-with-Dual-LED-Indicator-
This project demonstrates a frequency-selective analog circuit with a single input and two LED outputs.
LED-1 turns ON when input frequency is greater than 2 kHz; LED-2 turns ON at exactly 6 kHz.
The circuit uses resistors and capacitors based on filter design principles to detect specific frequencies.
LTspice (Linear Technology SPICE) was used for circuit simulation and waveform analysis.
